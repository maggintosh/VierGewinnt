CONNECT FOUR

This is a very simple implementation of the game "Connect Four". 
I do this for my computer science study. The game is written in 
Python and will be playable via console.

So this is my first game and "bigger" project written completely
by myself. It is very basic and simple, because i am actually
learning how to come along with Python.

You can play in two modes: PvP (Multiplayer Game) or Human versus 
CPU (Singleplayer Game). The size of the game board is 
customizable by the player.
